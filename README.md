# Project: Online Chocolate Shop

Online Chocolate Shop is a responsive E-Commerce website developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website has a description of the shop, categories of chocolate from which one can select and go through different items. A user can also contact the shop to place an order.

## Making of the Project:

We have used basic as well as advanced HTML tags to design the structure of the page and used different CSS styles to allow one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens. JavaScript Event like `onclick` is used to give smooth functioning of the website. A database is also created to store the user information when the contact form is filled. There is also a review section that helps a user to have a better understanding of the website and gives assurance of the products of the shop.
